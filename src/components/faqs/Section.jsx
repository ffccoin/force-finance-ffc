            <p>
              Sending cryptocurrency involves accessing your digital wallet,
              navigating to the "Send" or "Transfer" section, where you'll input
              the recipient's wallet address along with the desired amount of
              cryptocurrency. After reviewing the transaction details, including
              any applicable fees, you'll confirm the transaction to initiate
              the transfer. <br />
              <br /> Receiving cryptocurrency entails sharing your wallet's
              unique receiving address with the sender. Once they initiate the
              transfer to this address, you'll wait for the transaction to be
              confirmed on the blockchain network, at which point the
              cryptocurrency will be reflected in your wallet balance. Always
              ensure accuracy when sharing or inputting wallet addresses to
              prevent any errors in the transaction process.
